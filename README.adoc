= an http stack demo

== acknowlegment

The stream-to-a-blob-in-database-to-not-fill-the-memory feature is taken from there (but we use filesystem H2 instead of Postgres): https://github.com/janzyka/blobs-jpa


== how to use

=== stream to blob in DB

==== Create a large file
The goal is to showcase how to stream LARGE files to the DB without having to store all the bytes in memory.

Create a large file on Windows (50MB):

 fsutil file createnew test.txt 52428800

Create a large file in Java:

 try (RandomAccessFile raf = new RandomAccessFile(file, "rw")) {
    raf.setLength(newSize);
 } finally {
    raf.close();
 }
 
Create a large file in Linux:

 fallocate -l 10G gentoo_root.img

==== send it to server

 curl -D - -F "file=@lombok.jar" http://localhost:8080/blobs

you can monitor with VisualVM that the memory of the server did not increase.

== TODO

* websocket sample with and without STOMP
* real unit tests
